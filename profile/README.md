## The Problem with Centralized AI Today

- **Centralization of Infrastructure**: Control by a few large companies hinders innovation and access.
- **Inefficient Resource Utilization**: Wasted or underused computing resources slow industry advancement.
- **Centralization of Development**: Limited perspectives and innovation due to control by major entities.

## The Solution

### Infrastructure That Connects All Humans with Every AI
- **Globally Distributed Network**: Building a scalable, high-performance AI infrastructure that's accessible worldwide.
- **Democratizes Computing Resources**: Breaks down barriers to state-of-the-art computing for developers, researchers, and startups.
- **Resilience and Accessibility**: Ensures resources are resilient and meet the diverse demands of various AI applications.

### Intellegent Infrastructure
- **Intelligent Compute Fabric**: Creation of a cloud compute layer for smart allocation and utilization of resources within the ceτi AI Infrastructure Network.
- **Optimal Resource Matching**: The ceτi AI Intelligent Compute Fabric matches unused computing power with developers and decentralized AI networks efficiently.
- **Reduction of Waste**: Minimizes waste and lowers barriers to AI development.
- **Acceleration of Innovation and Cost Reduction**: Aims to speed up innovation and make AI development more accessible and affordable for everyone.

### Purpose Built Infrastructure
- **AI Focused Infrastructure**: Designed specifically for accelerating decentralized AI development.
- **Diverse Ecosystem Support**: Powers decentralized AI networks like Bittensor, Render, Akash, and others.
- **Global Developer Inclusion**: Enables worldwide developer participation, independent of major tech company affiliations.
- **Encourages Diversity**: Promotes varied perspectives and approaches to AI, enhancing application diversity.
- **Fosters Innovation**: Supports breakthroughs by leveraging the collective intelligence of decentralized communities.

# The CETI Token and Ecosystem

The CETI token serves as the cornerstone of the ceτi AI ecosystem, aimed at propelling the development of a decentralized AI infrastructure while rewarding the community's involvement. Its economic model is crafted to underpin the network's expansion, foster the creation of decentralized AI networks and applications, and ensure the sustainable appreciation of value for token holders.

## CETI Token Allocation

- **90% Launch Pairing**: 18,900,000 CETI tokens are paired with wTAO at the initiative's outset.
- **10% Team Tokens**: Divided equally into two portions:
  - 1,050,000 CETI for team and contributors, with a vesting period managed through Hedgey and/or Sablier.
  - 1,050,000 CETI dedicated to Team Operations, fully vested.

 This structured approach underlines our commitment to both network growth and the broader adoption of decentralized AI technologies.
